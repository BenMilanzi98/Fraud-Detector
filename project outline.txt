This App is called Fraud Buster, I want you to help me with implementing it by following the guidelines below.
The App Is for monitoring in and out transactions in systems.
Give alerts to users of the app if there are unusual transactions
The app must have its own database for storing users, and all records as we are not to use firebase or google authentication when launching it must show a splash screen written  "Smart Monitoring kit" with the App logo
After the splash screen the app must reach the authentication screen where a user is required to register or sign in. Once a user log in, must be taken to the dashboard.  The dashboard must have the following clickable cards: Total Transactions (if pressed, must take user to transactions screen, this screen will show all transactions which can be filter based on day, week or moth: these transactions will show amount, to or from number and method either Airtel Money or TNM Mpamba), Suspicious Transactions (if pressed, must take user to fraud transactions screen, this screen will show all fraud transactions which can be filter based on day, week or moth: these transactions will show amount, to or from number and method either Airtel Money or TNM Mpamba), Users (this will take user to users screen where all users are listed). These cards must be taking user to their own screens containing the information they are supposed to have. 
The dashboard must also have a graph showing daily, weekly or monthly transactions.
the app must also have a profile screen where user details can be modified and updated. It must have a side bar that has navigations like: Settings, Systems, API,  The app must have a beautiful clean purple inspired theme (dark/light), switchable using a theme toggle in the dashboard.  This app is for demonstration purposes so you have to create sample transaction data for 3 different systems named Old Mutual, NedBank and Village Bank. These systems must have sample transactions to Airtel Money and TNM Mpamba for at least 6 months each. Within the data there must be some suspicious transactions as well as clean transactions for demonstrations purposes. User must be able to select a system from the systems screen.  under API must be some mock details like the app has connected to those systems APIs
